# Todos

A running list of features and fixes I want to make. Newest ideas can go at the
bottom of each section; check things off as they ship.

## Fixes

- [x] **Item refresh tests failing** — mocked the SSRF guard in tests so refresh
  assertions pass without live DNS. Fix on `claude/fix-refresh-tests`.
- [x] **Verify Google sign-in renders in production** — after the Dockerfile
  build-arg fix deploys, load `/login` on the live site and complete a sign-in.

## Features

- [x] **Account menu / sign-out from the sidebar avatar** — clicking the
  bottom-left account block opens a page-centered Account settings modal with
  General (appearance + sign out) and Profile tabs.
- [x] **Editable display name / profile** — Profile tab lets users change their
  display name (PATCH /api/user); Google accounts can override the synced name
  (Google login no longer re-syncs name for linked accounts).
- [ ] **(add your next idea here)**

## Ideas / Maybe
